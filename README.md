# InstagramNonfollowbacks
This python project uses selenium to print out all of your non followbacks on Instagram with 110 lines of code (not optimized)
Optimize it if you can

***This project only works when instagram is on a medium or full sized screen***

fix that if you can

******************************************************************************************************
For different versions, there are different lines of code that we are supposed to use and I programmed this with the most recent updates. It is not completely done since it does not work on my computer but it will for some of you.

After I am finished with the scrolling part, I will make this project bigger and into a website or a module so all people have access

run "python3 instagramUnfollower.py" on VScode to run it and fix any errors if you can!
also consider using VPN since if you run it too many times, you will get banned from your instagram account (I know from personal experience)

# HAVE FUN!
